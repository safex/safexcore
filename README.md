### Ubuntu 18.04

A one liner for installing all dependencies on Ubuntu 18.04 is

```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config \
    libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libminiupnpc-dev \
    libunwind8-dev liblzma-dev libreadline6-dev libldns-dev libexpat1-dev \
    doxygen graphviz libpcsclite-dev
```

To build a debug version, just run `$ make debug-all` (or `make -j <Your number of cores> debug-all` to use all cores).

To build a release version, just run `$ make release-all` (or `make -j <Your number of cores> release-all` to use all cores).
